I therefore need to look further into this to ensure that auto-detection works as expected as oppose to having to explicitly select JSON-LD as the input format.
- This issue also upgrades the jsonld-java-sesame library as we were getting class cast acception between converion from String to Map.

This is an initial crack at addressing https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ANY23-280
Essentially, the main API difference is the complete removal of `public interface ContentExtractor extends Extractor<InputStream>` from the Extractor interface in the api module.
This patch has a long way to go with numerous failing tests however I wanted to post it for feedback.
Although Any23 still builds with -DskipTests, without that flag the failing tests are as follows

This issue is a rework of #33 which takes on board @ansell 's comments to add the new extractor as a separate module as oppose to inside of core. 
There are a number of classes which are cleaned up for JDK1.8 compliance.
In addition, this new functionality augments the default configuration by introducing a threshold for OpenIE extractions of 0.5. Anything below this value is not converted into triples.
I run a test extraction on a reasonably testing Webpage from the [PO.DAAC](http://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/aquarius) but right now i am not asserting anything.

These all have to do with the RDFa implementation failing to parse HTML.

My previous PR (#58) attempted to fix these issues by changing the default parser from NekoHTML to Jsoup. But alas, it turns out the RDFa implementation is using a completely different html parser under the hood, and it's the RDFa parser that's too strict, not ours, so changing ours from NekoHTML to Jsoup had no effect (although it did come with a nice 20% speed increase, so there's that). It seems that, for rio parsers, the input stream is parsed with Jsoup *only to get the document language* and then parsed **again** under the hood with who knows what.

Now, I simply check the RDF format to see if we're putting out XHTML. If we are, I first XHTML-ify the stream with Jsoup before sending it on to the rio RDF parser.

2.3.0 called a URI opaque if it had a non-null scheme and its path did not begin with ""/""

- Should we rename the classes `JSONWriter` to `JSONLDWriter` and `JSONWriterFactory` to `JSONLDWriterFactory`. 
- When using the REST API, should we use `jsonld` as output format  instead of `json`.

118,2446.0,Hans Brende,,5.0,4.0,5846890.0,,11.0,User,343.0,0.0,"Here is one possible alternative to the existing PR for ANY23-396.

**Pros:**

1. Fully backwards compatible
2. Extends `WriterFactory` with new `DelegatingWriterFactory` interface, which, rather than writing a `TripleHandler` to an output stream, writes a `TripleHandler` to another `TripleHandler`. This will allow users to produce a final domain-specific RDF graph of their choosing in Rover by implementing mapping/filtering `DelegatingWriterFactory` implementations. 
3. the `--format` flag in rover now represents a list of WriterFactory ids, rather than a single WriterFactory id. Each id in the list is composed with the one previous to it to construct the final `TripleHandler`. All writer factories in the list, except the last, are required to implement `DelegatingWriterFactory`.

**Cons:** 
1. this solution requires deprecating 3 methods in the `WriterFactory` interface (and then un-deprecating them in the extending `FormatWriterFactory` interface.) However, this drawback does not affect backwards compatibility. 

## ALTERNATIVE

In order to avoid the single ""con"" I have listed, the alternative to this solution would be, rather than extending the `WriterFactory` interface with `DelegatingWriterFactory`, to keep these two interfaces completely separate and define a new `DelegatingWriterFactoryRegistry` (analogous to the `WriterFactoryRegistry`) with a different `ServiceLoader` in order to load `DelegatingWriterFactory` implementations.

This is a security fix for a  vulnerability in your [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) `pom.xml` file(s).

The build files indicate that this project is resolving dependencies over HTTP instead of HTTPS.
This leaves your build vulnerable to allowing a [Man in the Middle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack) (MITM) attackers to execute arbitrary code on your or your computer or CI/CD system.

This vulnerability has a CVSS v3.0 Base Score of [8.1/10](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).

[POC code](https://max.computer/blog/how-to-take-over-the-computer-of-any-java-or-clojure-or-scala-developer/) has existed since 2014 to maliciously compromise a JAR file in-flight.
MITM attacks against HTTP are [increasingly common](https://security.stackexchange.com/a/12050), for example [Comcast is known to have done it to their own users](https://thenextweb.com/insights/2017/12/11/comcast-continues-to-inject-its-own-code-into-websites-you-visit/#).

This contribution is a part of a submission to the [GitHub Security Lab](https://securitylab.github.com/) Bug Bounty program.

## Detecting this and Future Vulnerabilities

This vulnerability was automatically detected by [LGTM.com](https://lgtm.com) using this [CodeQL Query](https://lgtm.com/rules/1511115648721/).

As of September 2019 LGTM.com and Semmle are [officially a part of GitHub](https://github.blog/2019-09-18-github-welcomes-semmle/).

You can automatically detect future vulnerabilities like this by enabling the free (for open-source) [LGTM App](https://github.com/marketplace/lgtm).

I'm not an employee of GitHub nor of Semmle, I'm simply a user of [LGTM.com](https://lgtm.com) and an open-source security researcher.
